### Overall Impression

***

Overall, this class was very challenging, but ultimately rewarding. Out of the 3 R classes I have taken throughout my academic career, I have learned the most in this one. I am really proud of what I accomplished this semester (even though I wish I had put even more into it, I am trying to be realistic), and I have grown a lot in my understanding of statistics and Rstudio.

### What did you accomplish?

***

Please let me know how many of the above tasks you accomplished. If any of them were accomplished later than stipulated, please note that. If you contacted me about them being late (and we discussed it and I said it was ok), please note that, too. You may provide a bulleted/numbered list matching the one above.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### How well did you accomplish them?

***

Please let me know how well you feel you accomplished your tasks, in a general sense. What do you feel you did the best, and what did you do the least well? What was the hardest part for you? Did your work/understanding/ease improve over the course of the semester?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project design changed since taking this course?

***

This may be in relation to previous knowledge, or in relation to future/planned work.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### What did you learn from all this?

***

Please name at least three things you feel you learned in this course.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### What did your learn about teamwork in this course? How did the readings on teamwork foster this understanding? How did the teamwork experiences?

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### How did the Peer Commentary process and Group Project relate, if at all, to what you view as your successes or difficulties in this course?

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### What, if anything, of lasting value do you take away from this experience? If nothing, what would you do differently if you were to start over in this course? 

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### Taking this self-assessment into account (and with **A** being the highest), if you were the instructor, what grade would you give yourself given your evaluation of your own performance this semester? Please be honest.

I think I would give myself a B. I am really proud of the work I did on the group module and the replication assignment, but I feel like I could have done better on the assignments, and could have given more meaningful feedback during peer commentary.
